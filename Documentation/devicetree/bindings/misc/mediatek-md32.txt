* Mediatek MD32

MD32 is a tiny processor sub-system. MD32 integrated with peripherals is
designed to handle specific tasks for base-band SoC, such as Sensor HUB.

Required properties:
  - compatible: "mediatek,mt8173-md32"
  - reg: physical base address of the md32 sram, md32 register and md32 clock control,
    length of memory mapped region, 0x38000 and 0x100 respectively.
  - interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
  - clocks : clock name from clock manager
  - clock-names: the clock of MD32 system

Example:
	md32@10020000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-md32";
		reg = <0 0x10020000 0 0x38000>,
		      <0 0x10050000 0 0x100>,
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 166 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&topckgen CLK_TOP_SCP_SEL>;
		clock-names = "sys";
	};
