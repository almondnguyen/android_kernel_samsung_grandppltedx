config MTK_CLKMGR
	bool "Mediatek proprietary clock management"
	default n
	---help---
	  Mediatek proprietary clock management is used to operate
          the clocks. The clocks are composed of CG, MUX, PLL,
          non-MTCMOS. The operations of clocks are enabling,
          disabling, and querying status. If this config is not set,
          system will use COMMON_CLK instead.

config SODI_ON
	bool "Enable SODI"
	depends on (ARCH_MT6735 || ARCH_MT6735M || ARCH_MT6753)
	default n
	help
	  Select if you want to enable Screen ON DeepIdle (SODI).

config MTK_CPU_HOTPLUG_DEBUG_0
	bool "MediaTek CPU Hotplug DEBUG 0"
	default y
	help
	  This kernel config can be used to enable log message in cpu notify
	  callback function in register_cpu_notifier. This is useful for CPU
	  hotplug debug.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config MTK_CPU_HOTPLUG_DEBUG_1
	bool "MediaTek CPU Hotplug DEBUG 1"
	default n
	help
	  This kernel config can be used to enable log message in cpu notify
	  callback function in notifier_call_chain. This is useful for CPU
	  hotplug debug but the performance will be drop down.
	  If unsure, say N.

config MTK_CPU_HOTPLUG_DEBUG_2
	bool "MediaTek CPU Hotplug DEBUG 2"
	default y
	help
	  This kernel config can be used to enable aee to log cpu notify
	  callback in notifier_call_chain. This is useful for CPU hotplug
	  debug.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config SYSTEM_BOOTUP_CPU_BOOST
	bool "Boost CPU performance to enhance boot speed"
	default n
	help
	  SYSTEM_BOOTUP_CPU_BOOST is to boost CPU performance to enhance boot
	  speed and save time cost during system booting. This mechanism
	  will recover DVFS/hotplug after system boot up done.

config CPU_DVFS_SYSTEM_BOOTUP_BOOST
	bool "cpu dvfs system bootup boost"
	default n 
	help
		CPU_DVFS_SYSTEM_BOOTUP_BOOST is used to enhance system bootup time by fixing
		CPU at max CPU frequency before bootup procedure finished. Say y here to enable
		it and say n to disable it.

config DISABLE_SCREEN_OFF_DVFS_ENHANCEMENT
	bool "Disable DVFS enhancement feature for screen off scenario"
	default n
	help
	  Select this option if you want to disable CPU DVFS enhancemnet
	  and let it free-run for screen off scenario.
